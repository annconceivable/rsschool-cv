## About me
For the last several years I was looking at code from another angle - as a support engineer. Probably the best about this job is drilling into all the details to solve complicated technical problems. At the same time it's necessary to collaborate closely with teammates, account managers and members from Product Group who develop the products. Englsh is the main language of communication since teams are spread across EMEA and the whole globe. I'm ready to start my journey as a Front-End Developer and I strongly believe my skills will help me with the task.
